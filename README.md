# Plant-Disease-ML
Plant disease prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is an effective and widely used approach in agriculture. CNNs are particularly well-suited for this task because they can automatically detect patterns, textures, and color variations in images, which are essential for identifying plant diseases.
